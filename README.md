# *Super Mario Spooky Adventure* Source Code
# Introduction
This is Spooky Adventure's source code. Heavily based on NewerSMBW's source code (with some differences, of course), it is what makes Spooky actually work, it allows the game to run, and the custom features to work! Now, this readme is quite boring and stupidly simple, but I'll add more in the future...
